# About

Hi, I'm **Captain CSEC**, a cybersecurity and aviation expert with a passion for both. I blend my expertise in protecting digital systems with my fascination for the aviation industry to bring unique insights into the world of aviation cybersecurity. My mission is to provide readers with up-to-date information on the threats and defenses facing modern aircraft, as well as how the aviation industry is adapting to the ever-evolving digital landscape.

# More Information

When I'm not diving into cybersecurity/aviation research, I enjoy various things such as snow kiting, swimming, swashbuckling, reading up on the latest aviation tech, and attending cybersecurity conferences. I also love sharing my knowledge through blogging and hope to inspire others to understand the importance of securing our skies in an increasingly connected world.
